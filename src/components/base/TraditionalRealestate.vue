                        <p>Professional Photography – We have recruited the best photographers in the city as part of our Sweetly team!  But before we rush out to take photos, we need to ensure your home is well-presented.  
                            We have an interior designer who provides a one-hour consultation to rearrange furniture, artwork and décor so 
                            your home looks its best!  You only get one chance to make a first impression, so let us help you maximize the “wow” 
                            factor when buyers open the door!  If the home is vacant, our designer can provide beautiful furnishings to stage your home,
                            or we can send vacant photos for virtual staging to help a buyer "see" what artwork, plants and furnishings could do to 
                            finish the space. </p><br>
                            <p>RMS Measurements – All of our homes are professionally measured as per the standards 
                                set forth by the Real Estate Council of Alberta. </p><br>
                            <p>Marketing - Once your property is measured and photographed, our marketing team gets to work! </p>
                            <p>1. We design high-quality brochures, along with our “Sweet Sheet” educating buyers on the renovations,
                                benefits and location of your home.</p>
                            <p>2. We order and install custom wall decals pointing out all of the unique (or hard to see) features and benefits as they walk through the home,
                                drawing their attention to all the ownership benefits of your home.</p>
                            <p>3. Sweetly creates a unique website for your listing.  We share it on our social media sites such as Facebook + Instagram stories, posts and paid ads; Realtor.ca, 
                                and all 3rd party real estate sites to give you maximum exposure.</p>
                            <p>4. Your listing will appear on all member websites associated with the Edmonton Real Estate board and affiliates of Realtor.ca.</p><br>
                            <p>The goal of our marketing is to educate buyers and their REALTORS® on the benefits of ownership, any recent renovations, and unique features of your home. We want to showcase why your home is more special and better than the house that is for sale down the road.</p>

If there are times your family has in-house commitments such as piano lessons or tutors, we can block those times out so buyers do not have the option to request showings at undesirable times.  We provide you with an app for your smartphone which lets you control the time and date for the showings and offers an easy schedule for you to refer to for scheduling.  We never publish your name or phone number, while ensuring that the only showings on the home must be approved by you.
                            We will provide showing feedback as soon as it is available.</p>

Together we will interpret this data to ensure you are the next one on the block to sell.  The best way to be a seller is to put yourself in the shoes

            <p>I was born in Edmonton, to parents from rural backgrounds and lived within blocks of the original Fort Edmonton and the Legislature building.</p>
            <p>My father was a building contractor, and I spent my preschool years with my dad at houses he was building. I learned about the housing industry, and as I got older became interested in the operation of the family business and eventually decided to become a Real Estate Professional. My oldest son followed in the same industry direction and is now a Real Estate Appraiser.</p>
            <p>When I had decided to become a Real Estate Professional, I originally started with Metro City Realty in June of 1995. I have enjoyed my work as a Realtor and have acquired considerable amounts of my own real estate during the time. I’m excited for my move to “Sweetly” as I know it will offer myself and my client’s new options and added benefits in the purchase and sale of their homes.</p>
