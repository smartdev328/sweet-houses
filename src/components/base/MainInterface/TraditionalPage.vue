I learned about the housing industry, and as I got older became interested in the operation of the family business and eventually decided to become a Real Estate Professional. My oldest son followed in the same industry direction and is now a Real Estate Appraiser.</p>

I have enjoyed my work as a Realtor and have acquired considerable amounts of my own real estate during the time.
