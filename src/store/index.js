            details:`
                <p>My career in Real Estate started in 2012, after working in the staging industry and always having an interest in residential living spaces. Prior to venturing into Real Estate I have also worked as a marketing and project coordinator in the advertising industry. That job took me for a time to London, UK. While there I had the opportunity to travel a bit around Europe to Greece, Italy, Germany, Poland and Spain. </p>
                <p>I first began in 'Staging', with a specific interest in Residential living spaces.  I found it fascinating how even the most unsuspecting spaces, with just a little effort and imagination could quickly be transformed into the backdrop of someone’s dream property!  Originally my educational background was in visual communications and marketing.  Seeing the big picture potential, I decided that it was best to also get my Real Estate License.  </p>
                <p>Having worked first in staging, then as an Agent, I believe in the value of educating my clients on every aspect of their purchase or sale.  I try to provide them with a balance of cold hard numbers and recent market comparables, combined with information about the less quantifiable ‘emotional factor’ that ultimately drives most Buyers and Sellers' decisions.  I want my clients to say that I advised them ‘best', based on their specific situation and helped steer them towards the ‘right’ decision for them at this given time.</p>
                <p>Feel free to contact me directly, I’m always interested in hearing your story and how I can help you find your dream home, through the use of my industry knowledge combined with your imagination!   </p>

            {title:'What is Sweetly?',content:`Sweetly is a full service, licensed brokerage offering more than just the traditional real estate model. Our owners are ex Re/Max agents who came together to form Canada's first ibuyer. Sweetly is the only brokerage that invests its’ own resources to literally buy your home so that you don't need to be 'for sale'. We offer a Swift Sale where we'll pay 90.1% of current market value on whatever day you choose as the date for possession (move out). We also offer a Sweet Sale where we'll buy your home in two payments - we'll make the necessary improvements to maximize the resale price, and pay you the full balance of the improved resale price less our fee. We also offer a Sweet Swap where you can trade your current home for your next one - you can buy any home you want, not just our inventory, And we offer an Equity Advance if you just want some of the cash from the home equity you've built up - you pay us back when the home sells.
            `},
            {title:`What's the cost of a Sweet Sale?
            `,content:`The Sweet Sale is the SMARTEST WAY to sell a house! Our fee to buy and resell your home is 2% of the value of the property plus our standard real estate commission (7/3) or 7% of $100,000 plus 3% on the balance of the sale price. The extra 2% covers the expenses we take on, like property tax, utilities, insurance, lawn/snow care, and mortgage payments. The fee is fixed and never increases regardless of how long it takes to sell the property.`},
            {title:`What's the catch?
            `,content:`We get this question every day — actually. There's really no catch! The Sweet Sale is NOT a buy low sell high model, so we don’t ‘low-ball’. With a Sweet Sale you get ALL the equity from your (fully renovated and ready to sell) home. You benefit from having us make the right improvements to sell your home for the highest price possible. Our Sweet Sale process is simply the easiest and smartest way to sell a home for the most money possible AND avoiding the stresses of public showings. The difference is more money for you, and the convenience of no public showings.`},
            {title:`Who gets the extra money if Sweetly re-sells my home for more than the original value?`,content:`You do! We re-sell homes for more than the original value by design of the Sweet Sale. It's because we make the right improvements that we know buyers can't resist, so our re-sales often sell for more than the original evaluated amount. You get that money! We only keep our fee (and our contractor costs for any improvements). You get the full balance of the resale price.`},
            {title:`Is the Sweet Sale program available to me if I’m already listed with another Realtor?`,content:`Yes, you can consider our offer through your current listing brokerage. We normally re-list the property with the same Realtor and we pay 1% of the value which is roughly half of what most full service Realtors charge.`},
            {title:`Who controls the asking/sale price once Sweetly puts the house for sale?`,content:`You do! Sweetly will list the house at the pre-determined value and we don’t accept any offer of less than 97% of that evaluation, without you’re permission. If we feel a price reduction is necessary we’ll tell you, and you can decide to either allow a reducton to attract more buyers, or leave it for sale at the same price – you’re in control for the first 30 days of our listing. If the home is not selling within 30 days, we'll adjust the price at our discretion to attract more buyers.`},
            {title:`How can I be sure that I'll get the second payment?`,content:`Your second payment is protected by a caveat registered on the title of your home which requires us to pay you before we can sell to anyone else. It’s the same level of protection a bank gets when they lend money on a property in the form of a mortgage.`},
            {title:`How do I know that Sweetly will seek the highest sale price?`,content:`Sweetly is the only Brokerage in Canada that buys and re-sells your home in a fair way. Our goal of getting the highest sale price is aligned with yours! We always seeks the highest price, and we commit to only accept offers no less than 97% of the original evaluation we provided to you. If for any reason, we can’t get to within 97% you’ll be consulted. We even give you the right to buy back the house by simply retuning our money any time before we’ve accepted an offer from anyone else.`},

We'd be happy to activate a free homes search based on your buying criteria. We'll show you any home for sale and when you find the right one we'll help you make an informed offer by showing you what the home last sold for (if available) and the recent comparable sales for the area to help you make good real estate decisions. Once you have a firm purchase Sweetly will buy your current home on the date that makes the most sense for you!`},

            {title:`Do I get to choose my own closing date?`,content:`Yes, you get to choose a date that works for you which is materially different than selling your home to a traditional buyer that may need the home on a date that works for them.`},
            {title:`Is the offer I get subject to commissions?`,content:`No. You don't pay commissions when you sell to us.

            {title:`What types of homes will you absolutely NOT buy?
            `,content:`Homes we buy must be vacant on possession date. We cannot assume any tenancies. We can't buy any homes that require significant work such as foundation problems, etc.. We also cannot buy a mobile home or other type of property that doesn't include title to land or a city lot. At this time we are not buying most condominiums, or commercial property, and some smaller communities throughout Alberta.`},
            {title:`Is this a Guaranteed Sale program?
            `,content:`NO! A Guaranteed Sale is a gimmick some agents use to get your listing. Sweetly provides a clean offer and an actual sale - NO LISTING required. Guaranteed Sale programs require you to list the home for a period of time, then if the brokerage buys the home and resells it for more they keep the profit. That's not Sweetly.

We take photos and measurements, introduce the home to the buying public, post the home on the MLS, hold open houses, book showings, deal with agents, buyers, inspectors and appraisers. We negotiate with buyers and re-sell the home on the open market. Basically, we do all the work, pay for all the holding costs and handle all the stress associated with selling a house.

            {title:`What happens if the inspector finds problems in my home?
            `,content:`Don't worry. We are not a nervous buyer. Home inspections most often (actually always) yield some kind of deficiency or maintenance requirement. Once we know what those are we'll review them with you and discuss possible remedies if needed. If there's something seriously wrong with your home (like a faulty foundation) we'll likely need to pass on buying your home as we simply don't have the resources to deal with substantial issues of that sort.
            `},
            {title:`When will I need to move out of my house?

            `,content:`Yes, but please note that all of the appliances (Chattels) listed on the contract need to stay with the home. These will normally include the Fridge, Stove, Hood fan, Washer and Dryer, Window coverings, Garage door opener and remotes, built in speaker systems, closet organizers, etc. If any of these items are important for you to take with you, you'll need to ensure they are not included in the sale.
