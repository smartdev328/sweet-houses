            details:`
                <p>My career in Real Estate started in 2012, after working in the staging industry and always having an interest in residential living spaces. Prior to venturing into Real Estate I have also worked as a marketing and project coordinator in the advertising industry. That job took me for a time to London, UK. While there I had the opportunity to travel a bit around Europe to Greece, Italy, Germany, Poland and Spain. </p>
                <p>I first began in 'Staging', with a specific interest in Residential living spaces.  I found it fascinating how even the most unsuspecting spaces, with just a little effort and imagination could quickly be transformed into the backdrop of someone’s dream property!  Originally my educational background was in visual communications and marketing.  Seeing the big picture potential, I decided that it was best to also get my Real Estate License.  </p>
                <p>Having worked first in staging, then as an Agent, I believe in the value of educating my clients on every aspect of their purchase or sale.  I try to provide them with a balance of cold hard numbers and recent market comparables, combined with information about the less quantifiable ‘emotional factor’ that ultimately drives most Buyers and Sellers' decisions.  I want my clients to say that I advised them ‘best', based on their specific situation and helped steer them towards the ‘right’ decision for them at this given time.</p>
                <p>Feel free to contact me directly, I’m always interested in hearing your story and how I can help you find your dream home, through the use of my industry knowledge combined with your imagination!   </p>
