        <!-- <h4>Policies Applicable to Participants’ VOWs </h4>
        <br />
        <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
          <li>Participants may provide additional Brokerage services via a VOW in addition to making  MLS® System listing data available, but only to consumers with whom the Participants  have first established relationships, including completion of all actions and/or forms  respecting agency disclosure required by provincial law or regulation in connection with  providing real estate Brokerage services to clients and customers (hereinafter  “Registrants). The Cooperative recommends that the most current Agency  Relationships Guide be displayed for consumer review and acceptance. Such  acceptance should require a click to accept at the Buyer Brokerage Verification section
              and another click at the signatureline. </li>
          <li>
            <p>Participants’ VOWs must obtain the identity of each Registrant and obtain each  Registrant’s agreement to “Terms of Use” of the VOW, as follows: </p>
            <ol class="pl-4" style="list-style: lower-roman;">
              <li>A Registrant must provide their name, a current telephone number and a valid  email address. The Participant must send an email to the address provided by  the Registrant and confirming that the Registrant has agreed to the Terms of  Use (described in subsection c below). The Registrant may be permitted to  access the VOW only after the Participant has verified that the email address  provided is valid and the Registrant’s 
                agreement to the VOW’s Terms of Useis  confirmed. </li>
                <li>The Registrant must supply a username and a password, the combination of  which must be different from those of all other Registrants on the VOW, before  being permitted to search and view information from the MLS® System
                  database via the VOW. The username and password may be established by the  Registrant or may be supplied by the Participant, at the option of the Participant.  An email address may be associated with only one username and password. The Registrant’s password and access must expire on a date certain at a  maximum of 30 days but may be renewed. 
                </li>
                <li>The Participant must at all times maintain a record of the name, telephone  
                  number and email address supplied by the Registrant, and the username and  current password of each 
                  Registrant, such records to be kept for not less than  180 days after the expiration of the validity of the 
                  Registrant’s password. If the  Cooperative has reason to believe that a Participant’s VOW has caused or 
                   permitted a breach in the security of the data or a violation of MLS® System  rules related to use by one or more 
                   Registrants, the Participant shall, upon  request, provide to the Cooperative a copy of the record of the name, email
                     address, telephone number, username, current password, and audit trail, if  required, of any Registrant identified 
                     by the Cooperative to be suspected of  involvement in the violation.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> The Registrant must be required to affirmatively express agreement to a Terms of  Use provision that requires the Registrant to open and review an agreement that  provides at least the following: </p>
              <ol class="pl-4" style="list-style: lower-roman;">
                <li>That the Registrant acknowledges that the Terms of Use do not create an  agency relationship with the Participant;</li>
                <li>That all data obtained from the VOW is intended only for the Registrant’s personal,  non-commercial use;</li>
                <li>That the Registrant has a bona fide interest in the purchase, sale, or lease of  real estate of the type being offered through the VOW; </li>
                <li>
                  That the Registrant will not copy, redistribute or retransmit any of the data  or information provided
                </li>
                <li>
                  That the Registrant acknowledges Cooperative ownership of and the  validity ofthe copyright in the MLS® System database;
                </li>
              </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            That the Registrant agrees that all information provided may be provided to the  Cooperative and may be used to administer and operate the VOW and to investigate  any breach of security of the data or the MLS® System rules. After the Registrant has  opened for viewing the Terms of Use agreement, a “mouse click” is sufficient to  acknowledge agreement to those terms. The Terms of Use Agreement shall not impose  a financial obligation on the Registrant or create any representation agreement between  the Registrant and the Participant. An agreement entered into at any time between the  Participant and Registrant imposing a financial obligation on the Registrant or creating  agency representation of the Registrant by the Participant must be established  separately from the Terms of Use, must be prominently labelled and may not be  accepted solely by mouse click.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>A Participant’s website must protect the MLS® System data from misappropriation by  employing reasonable efforts to monitor for and prevent “scraping” or other  unauthorized accessing, reproduction or use of the MLS® System database. f. A Participant’s website must comply with the following additionalrequirements: </p>

                  A Participant’s website must display a privacy policy that informs Registrants of  the ways in which information obtained from them will be used.
