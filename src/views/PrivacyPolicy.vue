                    <h3>"Personally Identifiable Information"
</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Personally Identifiable Information refers to any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains, including, but not limited to, name, address, phone number, fax number, e-mail address, financial profile, social security number, and credit card information. Personally Identifiable Information does not include information that is collected anonymously (that is, without identification of the individual user) or demographic information not connected to an identified individual.

</p>
<br>
<p>What Personally Identifiable Information is collected?

<br>
<p>What Personally Identifiable Information is collected?

</p>
<br>
<p>What organizations are collecting the information?

</p>
<br>
<p>In addition to our direct collection of information, our third-party service vendors (such as mortgage lenders, insurance brokers, and title companies), which may provide such services as mortgage lending, mortgage insurance, escrow services, and title insurance, may collect this information from our Visitors and Authorized Customers. We do not control how these third parties use such information, but we do ask them to disclose how they use personal information provided to them by Visitors and Authorized Customers. Some of these third parties may be intermediaries that act solely as links in the distribution chain, and do not store, retain, or use the information provided to them.

</p>
<br>
<p>How does the Site use Personally Identifiable Information?

</p>
<br>
<p>We use Personally Identifiable Information to customize the Site, to make appropriate service offerings, and to fulfill requests to buy or sell made on the Site. We may e-mail Visitors and Authorized Customers about research or opportunities to purchase and sell on the Site or information related to the subject matter of the Site. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to contact Visitors and Authorized Customers in response to specific inquiries, or to provide requested information.

</p>
<br>
<p>
    With whom may the information be shared?


</p>
<br>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information pertaining to Authorized Customers and other non-personally identifiable information will be shared with our employees and with third-party service providers who assist us with our Site operations or other services we may offer. Personally Identifiable Information about Authorized Customers may be shared with other Authorized Customers and other providers of real estate-related services, such as mortgage lenders we work with, which wish to evaluate potential transactions with other Authorized Customers and/or us. Further, we may share aggregated information about our Visitors and Authorized Customers, including demographics, with our affiliated agencies and third-party vendors. We also offer the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving information or being contacted by us or by any agency acting on our behalf. Our employees, agents, third-party service providers and partners are contractually bound to use Personally Identifiable Information solely in connection with providing the Services, and may not use it for any other purpose.

</p>
<br>
<p>We may disclose information provided by Visitors as part of any merger, sale, acquisition, or financing of our company. Furthermore, in some instances, we may be legally required to provide information about Visitors to government authorities, including law enforcement, Homeland Security, and intelligence agencies. We cooperate with law enforcement in identifying persons using our Services for illegal activities and reserve the right to report any activities that we believe to be unlawful or in violation of our Terms and Conditions.

</p>
<br>
<p>How is Personally Identifiable Information stored?
</p>
<br>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by the Company is securely stored in accordance with current industry standards and is not accessible to third parties or employees of the Company except for use as indicated above.

</p>
<br>
<p>What choices are available to Visitors regarding collection, use and distribution of the information?
</p>
<br>
<p>Visitors and Authorized Customers may opt out of receiving unsolicited information from us or being contacted by us and/or our vendors and affiliated agencies, as well as request of us and receive from us information on the specific elements of their Personally Identifiable Information being held by us, by responding to e-mails as instructed, or by contacting us at:

<h4>Are Cookies used on the Site?
</h4>
<br>
<p>Cookies are used on the Site for a variety of reasons. We use Cookies to obtain information about the preferences of our Visitors and the services they select. We also use Cookies for security purposes to protect our Authorized Customers. For example, if an Authorized Customer registers for a free account after using the Site services, Cookies allow us to securely associate the Authorized Customer's search preferences with the newly created account.

</p>

<br>
<h4>Can a Visitor delete or deactivate Personally Identifiable Information collected by the Site?
</h4>
<p>We provide Visitors and Authorized Customers with a mechanism to request data deletion of Personally Identifiable Information from the Site's database by contacting us via the information provided in this Privacy Policy, as well as to direct any of the third-party service providers which assist us with our Site operations or other services we may offer to delete/deactivate Personally Identifiable Information held by them which was originally received by them from us. However, because of backups and records of deletions, it may be impossible to delete a Visitor's entry without retaining some residual information. An individual who requests to have Personally Identifiable Information deactivated will have this information functionally deleted, and we will not sell, transfer, or use Personally Identifiable Information relating to that individual in any way moving forward.
